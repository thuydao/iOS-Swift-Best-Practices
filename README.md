### Project Structure

To keep all those hundreds of source files from ending up in the same directory, it's a good idea to set up some folder structure depending on your architecture. For instance, you can use the following:

    ├─ 01-App
    ├─ 02-Libs (3rd ..)
    ├─ 03-Helpers (this is common or util files of the project)
    ├─ 04-Models 
    ├─ 05-Resources (image, DB file, HTML, CSS, JS, StoryBoard...)
    ├─ 06-BussinessController (control of Bussiness/logic)
    ├─ 07-ViewControllers (View & control of view)
